## Classisc_ML
Classic ML models and implementation using mainly Scikit-learn, Pandas, SeaBorn, NumPy, Matplotlib and more. 
Datasets were taken from Kaggle:

BankChurners_Skewed_data.py

Analyzing dataset of credit card customers and predict which customers will likly to be churning their card. Classification problem in which I preproccesing by observing the data, dealing with outliers and NaN's, and feature engineering. 

Kaggle-Titanic.py

Utilized the Titanic dataset of survived passengers to understand if a collective of algorithms may achieve better results than one algorithms. I preprocessed the data and utilized random forest, gradient boosting and adaboost. The collective didnâ€™t exhibit an improvement in accuracy.

TzachyHousePrediction.py

Housing Prices Prediction Competition. Regression problem which I approached by preproccesing by visual the data, outliers and NaN's work and feature engineering. The data was analyzed by averaging ensemble of random forest, Adaboost and Gradient boosting to achieve the highest accuarcy score.  

Tzachy-CancerCostUS.py

Cancer Treatment cost dataset analyzed by Preprocceing and Stacking. The data is accompanied by a Notebook: Cancer Treatment Cost | Beginner's guide. This notebook is a simple overview that will go over basic skills for data science and demonstrate how a code should look like:
