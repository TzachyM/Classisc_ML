# Classisc_ML
Classic ML models and implementation using mainly Scikit-learn, Pandas, SeaBorn, NumPy, Matplotlib and more. 
Datasets were taken from Kaggle:
- Kaggle-Titanic.py - Predict survival on the Titanic Competition. Regression with classic machine learning algorithms
- TzachyHousePrediction.py - Housing Prices Prediction Competition. Classification with classic machine learning algorithms
- Tzachy-CancerCostUS.py - Cancer Treatment cost: Link to the Cancer Treatment Cost | Beginner's guide: Prep and Stacking. This notebook is a simple overview that will go over basic skills for data science and demonstrate how a code should look like:
