## Classisc_ML
Classic ML models and implementation using mainly Scikit-learn, Pandas, SeaBorn, NumPy, Matplotlib and more. 
Datasets were taken from Kaggle:
- #BankChurners_Skewed_data.py
Analyzing highly skewed dataset of credit card customers and predict which customers will likly to be churning their card. I preproccesing by visual the data, dealing with outliers and NaN's, located which features had high skewness and feature engineering. 
- #Kaggle-Titanic.py:
Predicted the survival on the Titanic Competition dataset. Regression problem which I approached by preproccesing by visual the data, outliers and NaN's work and feature engineering. The data was analyzed by averaging ensemble of random forest, Adaboost and Gradient boosting to achieve the highest accuarcy score.  
- TzachyHousePrediction.py - Housing Prices Prediction Competition. Classification with classic machine learning algorithms
- Tzachy-CancerCostUS.py - Cancer Treatment cost: Link to the Cancer Treatment Cost | Beginner's guide: Prep and Stacking. This notebook is a simple overview that will go over basic skills for data science and demonstrate how a code should look like:
