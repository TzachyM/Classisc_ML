## Classisc_ML
Classic ML models and implementation using mainly Scikit-learn, Pandas, SeaBorn, NumPy, Matplotlib and more. 
Datasets were taken from Kaggle:

BankChurners_Skewed_data.py

Analyzing dataset of credit card customers and predict which customers will likly to be churning their card. Classification problem in which I preproccesing by observing the data, dealing with outliers and NaN's, and feature engineering. 

Kaggle-Titanic.py

Utilized the Titanic dataset of survived passengers to understand if a collective of algorithms may achieve better results than one algorithms. I preprocessed the data and utilized random forest, gradient boosting and adaboost. The ensemble didnâ€™t exhibit an improvement in accuracy.

TzachyHousePrediction.py

Utilized the Housing Prices Prediction dataset to observe the difference between algorithms averaging and algorithms stacking. I preproccesed the data and utilized lightGBM, lasso and gradient boosting. Stacking was more effective to accurate predict the house prices.

Tzachy-CancerCostUS.py

Cancer Treatment cost dataset analyzed by Preprocceing and Stacking. The data is accompanied by a Notebook: Cancer Treatment Cost | Beginner's guide. This notebook is a simple overview that will go over basic skills for data science and demonstrate how a code should look like:
